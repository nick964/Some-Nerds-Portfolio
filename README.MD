# Some Nerds Website!

Some Nerds studio is a collaborative effort between my sister and I, focusing on buildling responsive websites for small businesses and custom snapchat filters for special events.

I reused the framework I used for my personal portfolio site, nrobinson.co, and reworked it to fit this site. There isn't anything super fancy about the site, its a simple landing page that takes advantage of a lot of Bootstrap and animate.css.
